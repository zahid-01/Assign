                        6: Web Storage:
                        Replaces traditional cookies for client-side data storage. Supports larger data storage and improved security.
                        
                        7: Web Workers: Allows background processing
                        without blocking the main thread. Enhances web
                        application performance and responsiveness.
                         8: WebSockets:
                        Enables real-time, full-duplex communication between the
                        client and server. Useful for chat applications and
                        real-time updates.
                        9: Drag and Drop: Native support for
                        drag-and-drop functionality. Simplifies user
                        interactions with web applications.
                        10: Forms: New input
                        types (e.g., <input type="date" />,
                        <input type="email" />). Form validation with the
                        required attribute. Enhanced support for form elements.
                       11: SVG and MathML: Native support for Scalable Vector
                        Graphics (SVG). Native support for Mathematical Markup
                        Language (MathML). 
                        12: Improved Accessibility: ARIA
                        (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) support for
                        enhanced web accessibility. Semantic elements improve
                        screen reader compatibility.
                        13 : Offline Application Cache:
                        The Application Cache API for offline web applications.
                        Allows resources to be cached and accessed without an
                        internet connection.

                        Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG): Allows for the inclusion
                        of vector graphics within web pages. Supports responsive
                        and scalable graphics.
