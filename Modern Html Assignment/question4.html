<!-- List any 3 ways which helps us in improving the accessibility of html -->

Improving the accessibility of HTML can be achieved through various techniques
and practices. Below are some important things to keep in mind: Semantic HTML
Elements: Use semantic HTML elements to provide meaningful structure to your
content. Semantic elements like
<header>
  ,
  <nav>
    ,
    <main>
      ,
      <article>
        ,
        <section>
          , and
          <footer>
            help screen readers and search engines understand the content's
            hierarchy and purpose. Avoid using non-semantic elements (e.g.,
            <div>
              ,
              <span
                >) when more descriptive semantic elements are available. Use
                headings (
                <h1>
                  to
                  <h6>
                    ) to organize content hierarchically. Ensure proper nesting
                    and avoid skipping heading levels. Alternative Text for
                    Images: Provide descriptive alternative text (alt text) for
                    images using the alt attribute in the <img /> element. Alt
                    text should convey the content and function of the image.
                    Use empty alt attributes for decorative images (e.g.,
                    <img src="decorative.png" alt="" />) to indicate that the
                    image serves no content or functional purpose. For complex
                    images, graphs, or charts, consider providing long
                    descriptions or linking to a detailed description. Keyboard
                    Accessibility: Ensure that all interactive elements, such as
                    links, buttons, form fields, and navigation menus, can be
                    accessed and used with a keyboard. Use the tabindex
                    attribute to specify the order in which elements receive
                    keyboard focus, but do so sparingly and maintain a logical
                    tab order. Provide clear and visible focus styles (e.g.,
                    outlines or highlighting) for focused elements to indicate
                    keyboard navigation.
                  </h6>
                </h1></span
              >
            </div>
          </footer>
        </section>
      </article>
    </main>
  </nav>
</header>
