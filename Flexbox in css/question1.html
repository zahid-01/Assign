<!-- Describe the main differences between the CSS Flexbox layout modal and the CSS Grid layout model. When
would you choose to use one over the other? -->

CSS Flexbox Layout Model: One-Dimensional Layout: Flexbox is primarily used for
one-dimensional layouts, either in a row (horizontal) or column (vertical)
direction. It's best suited for organizing content within a single axis.
Content-Based Sizing: Flexbox excels at distributing space based on the content
size of the items within a container. It can automatically adjust the size of
items to fill available space. Alignment: It provides powerful tools for
aligning items within the flex container, including centering, distribution, and
order control. Responsive Design: Flexbox is great for building responsive
designs, such as navigation menus or card layouts that need to adapt to varying
content sizes. CSS Grid Layout Model: Two-Dimensional Layout: Grid is designed
for two-dimensional layouts, allowing us to create rows and columns to position
and align items in both directions. It's ideal for grid-based designs. Fixed
Sizing: Grid allows us to set fixed sizes for rows and columns, making it
suitable for grid structures with a fixed number of cells. Grid Gaps: we can
easily create grid gaps (margins) between rows and columns, providing precise
control over the layout. Alignment: Grid provides alignment control within both
rows and columns. It's particularly useful for aligning items in both axes.
Complex Layouts: Grid is excellent for creating complex, multi-column, and
multi-row layouts, such as grids of images, tables, or dashboard-like designs.
When can we Choose Flexbox: Use Flexbox when we need to arrange items along a
single axis, like in a navigation menu or a flexible card layout. Choose Flexbox
for content-based sizing, where items should expand or shrink to fit their
content or available space. Flexbox is great for vertically centering content
within a container. When can we Choose Grid: Use Grid when we need to create
two-dimensional layouts with rows and columns, like magazine-style layouts or
complex forms. Choose Grid when we need precise control over the sizing and
positioning of items, such as a grid of images or a dashboard layout. Grid is
ideal for responsive designs that require adaptive, grid-based structures.
