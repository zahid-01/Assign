<!-- Explain the role of the following key properties in the Flexbox layout model
1. justify content
2. align-items
3. gap
4. flex-direction
5. flex-wrap -->

justify-content: justify-content is used to control the alignment of flex items
along the main (row or column) axis of the flex container. Values include:
flex-start (default), flex-end, center, space-between, and space-around.
flex-start aligns items at the start of the main axis. flex-end aligns items at
the end of the main axis. center centers items along the main axis.
space-between evenly distributes items with no space before the first item or
after the last item. space-around evenly distributes items with space before the
first and after the last items.

2:align-items: align-items controls the alignment of flex items along the cross
(opposite) axis of the flex container. Values include: stretch (default),
flex-start, flex-end, center, and baseline. stretch makes items fill the entire
cross-axis height, equalizing their heights. flex-start aligns items at the
start of the cross axis. flex-end aligns items at the end of the cross axis.
center centers items along the cross axis. baseline aligns items such that their
baselines align, which is useful for aligning text or inline elements.

<hr />
3:gap: The gap property (and its equivalents, row-gap and column-gap) is used to
control the spacing between flex items within the flex container. It specifies
the space between items in both the main and cross axes. It is especially useful
for creating consistent gutters and margins between flex items without the need
for extra margins or padding on individual items.
<hr />

4:flex-direction: flex-direction determines the direction in which flex items
are placed within the flex container. Values include: row (default),
row-reverse, column, and column-reverse. row arranges items in rows from the
start of the main axis to the end. row-reverse arranges items in rows from the
end to the start. column arranges items in columns from the start of the main
axis to the end. column-reverse arranges items in columns from the end to the
start.

<hr />
flex-wrap: flex-wrap controls whether flex items are allowed to wrap onto
multiple lines when they don't fit within the flex container's available space.
Values include: nowrap (default), wrap, and wrap-reverse. nowrap prevents items
from wrapping to a new line, causing overflow if they don't fit. wrap allows
items to wrap to a new line when necessary. wrap-reverse wraps items in the
reverse order
