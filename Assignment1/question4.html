<!-- In HTML tags are the building blocks of the language.They are used to keep
    content enclosed and also provide instructions on how the content should be
    displayed. The Tags are enclosed like brackets(<,>). There are mainly two
    types:1- Opening Tag, 2- Closing Tag. the starting
    <a> is the opening of the tag and </a>this is the closing of the tag. eg: -->

<a href="example.com">Visit Example</a>

<!-- On the other hand Elements are the complete structure made up of both
    opening and closing tags along with the content in it. eg: -->
<p>This is a <em>paragraph</em> with some <strong>emphasized</strong> text.</p>
