<!-- Define Favicon and give an illustrative example -->

A favicon (short for "favorite icon") is a small, typically square or
rectangular image that is associated with a website or web page. It is displayed
in various places within web browsers to help users identify and recognize a
specific website, especially when they have multiple tabs or bookmarks open.
Favicon images are usually 16x16 pixels or 32x32 pixels in size and are saved in
ICO (icon) format.
