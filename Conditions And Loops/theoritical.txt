Loops are programming constructs that allow for the repetition of a set of instructions or statements. They are essential for automating repetitive tasks and iterating over collections of data. There are several types of loops in most programming languages, including:

For Loop:

Syntax:
javascript

for (initialization; condition; update) {
  // code to be repeated
}
Example:
javascript

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
While Loop:

Syntax:
javascript

while (condition) {
  // code to be repeated
}
Example:
javascript

let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
Do-While Loop:

Syntax:
javascript

do {
  // code to be repeated
} while (condition);
Example:
javascript

let i = 0;
do {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 5);
These loops provide different ways to control the flow of iteration based on specific conditions. The choice of loop depends on the nature of the problem and the iteration requirements.
