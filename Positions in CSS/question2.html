<!-- Explain the difference between Relative and Absolute positioning -->

1-Relative Positioning: When we apply relative positioning to an element, it is
positioned relative to its normal position within the document flow. The element
is moved from its default position based on properties like top, right, bottom,
or left. These properties specify the offset from its original position. The
space originally occupied by the element is reserved in the layout, even if we
move it. In other words, adjacent elements are not affected by the relative
positioning. Relative positioning is often used when you want to fine-tune the
positioning of elements without disturbing the layout of other elements.
2-Absolute Positioning: When we apply absolute positioning to an element, it is
positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor (or the initial
containing block if no positioned ancestor exists). The element is removed from
the normal document flow, and its position is determined by properties like top,
right, bottom, or left. These properties specify the offset from the closest
positioned ancestor. The space originally occupied by the element is no longer
reserved in the layout. This means adjacent elements may overlap with the
absolutely positioned element.
